IR FINAL PROJECT
-----------------------
Details of student :-
=======================
NAME:- E.PAVAN SAI SANTHOSH.
ROLL NUMBER:- S20180010053 .

Details of project :-
========================
1. Domain of Project         :-    News .
2. Corpus source             :-    Kaggele crawled data sets from summary news .
3. No of documents collected :-    98401 .
4. Algorihtms used           :-    TF-IDF Weighting , Cosine Similarity .

Tasks Implemented :-
=========================
1) Ranked retrival .
2) User Sugestion Based on Query Expansion and previous searches .

Speciality :-
=========================
1) No inbuilt libraries are used .Everthing is implemented from scratch .
2) Only the basic libraries are used and pickle library is used to store inverted index .

Implementation :-
=========================
step-1 ) read the documents .
step-2 ) preprocess and create an inverted index .
step-3 ) used cosine similarity and TF-IDF Weighting to get the relevant documents .
step-4 ) used query expansion and previous related searches in order to get the suggestions .
step-5 ) improved the code .
step-6 ) i used comments so that every body can easily understand my code .

Time complexity:-
=========================
The time complexity for my code is O(n) .
where n is the number of documents .

Space Complexity:-
==========================
The space complexity for my code is O(n) .
where n is the number of documents .

STEPS TO RUN MY PROJECT :-
===========================
1) Extract the Zip file .
2) I attached the news dataset with the zip file .
3) I also attatched dict.pickle file which is a inverted index created file using pickle library .
4) Just run the cell
